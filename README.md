# Avengers Soundboard
Welcome to the Marvel Cellular-phone Universe (MCU).

Here you can find some of the most iconic quotes from your favorite, original six, Avengers. That means there are thirty-six sounds to choose from. And if you're looking for a little surprise, tap on that banner on the Avenger Selection Page! :)

# What I Learned
I wanted to make my code modular enough so that, when I add a new Avenger, I'm not making a whole new file for that Avenger and having to route to that on button click. Rather, I just wanted to be able to import the soundfiles and add a few lines of code to the sound_btn_brain file and have that Avenger's sound page up and running. Although this adds a lot more dependencies, it saves me a lot of time for future additions to the Avengers lineup I have.

Overall, this experience was a great next step for me from the simplicity of my project "Michael's Button". Not only did I get to use some object oriented programming skills like encapsulation and abstraction, but I also got to practice my regular Dart programming along with Flutter/Dart programming. I also got to work on my UI design, color choice, and techniques to navigage between pages. It really helped me cement my fundamentals in Flutter/Dart.

# The Next Step
I am currently trying to get this app onto the playStore. Getting it onto the AppStore is a whole nother behemoth I will need to work on as well. I'm not sure how copyright laws work with apps either, but I'm excited to find out! So step 1 is to get this version of the app onto a playstore.

Also, I purposefully did not include any quotes from Infinity War or EndGame in this project. So I hope to come out with an expansion pack in the future with quotes from those movies as well. This means I will increase the number of buttons per Avenger. I would also like to come out with expansion packs for some more Avengers, like Black Panther, Spider-Man (rip), Captain Marvel, etc.
